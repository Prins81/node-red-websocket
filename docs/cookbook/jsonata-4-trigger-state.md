# JSONata Example 4 - Trigger: State Node

The **Trigger State** node is very similar to the Events: State node. It will trigger when a given entity state changes, but the node has the opportunity to add conditions using UI fields to contruct complex tests. This removes much of the need to manage conditional tests using JSONata, however with more than one condition, each are combined with a logic 'AND' without any facility to use 'OR'.
